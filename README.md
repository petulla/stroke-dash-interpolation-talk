# stroke-dash-interpolation-talk
Slides from March d3.js talk at Pivotal Labs are in the .key and .pdf files

This talk teaches how to make [this type](http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2013/10/13/russia/) of long-form interactive created by the New York Times.

Three key concepts:

1. `getPointAtLength()` (example1.html / example2.html / example3.html)
1. `Stroke-dasharray` (example2.html / example3.html)
2. `getTotalLength()` (example1.html / example2.html / example3.html)

An additional explainer [can be found in this gist](https://gist.github.com/petulla/2525ffad1705c99ae7d2).
